## Previous experience
I have used R for matrix operations as a supplement to SQl querying at an internship. I have experience in the other tools.


## Inflation rate vs stored cash at the central bank
Data has been downloaded from SCB in Excel format. Empty lines and comments were removed, the tables transposed, and the data exported to a csv file.
The data refers to the inflation rate (KPIF) for the months 2008M01 to 2019M08, as well as Sweden's three major banks' reported funds at the Riksbank.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(reshape2)
RB <- read_csv(file = "RB.csv")
```

## Results
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(RB,aes(x=Rate,y=SWED))+
    geom_point()+
    scale_y_log10()




ggplot(RB,aes(x=Rate,y=SEB))+
    geom_point()+
    scale_y_log10()




ggplot(RB,aes(x=Rate,y=SHB))+
    geom_point()+
    scale_y_log10()

```
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
